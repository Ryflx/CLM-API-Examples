## Remote Access Guide
To access the application from a different machine:
1. Access the app using the host machine's IP: http://host-ip:8501?base_url=http://host-ip:8501
2. Click "Connect to DocuSign"
3. Copy the provided authentication URL
4. Open the copied URL in your browser to complete authentication
5. You will be redirected back to the application with proper authentication

Note: Replace "host-ip" with the actual IP address of the machine running the Docker container.
