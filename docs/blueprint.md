# DocuSign CLM Integration Project Blueprint

## Project Overview
A Python-based Streamlit application that integrates with DocuSign CLM API for contract lifecycle management capabilities. The application handles authentication and token management for DocuSign integration.

## Current Status
- Basic application structure implemented
- DocuSign OAuth integration completed
- Token management system in place
- Environment configuration set up
- CLM API integration started
  - DocLauncher Tasks implementation (Use Case 1):
    - Fetch and display DocGen configurations
    - Configuration selection interface
    - XML payload input and validation
    - DocLauncher task creation with selected config
    - Display of DocLauncher Result URL
- Comprehensive API logging system implemented
  - Daily rotating log files
  - Detailed request/response logging
  - Error tracking and debugging support
  - Robust object serialization for logging
  - Proper handling of complex DocuSign objects

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Streamlit (for web interface)
- DocuSign CLM API
- Environment configuration for secure credential management
- Logging system for API monitoring
- Requests library for API calls

## Features
### Current
- Project initialization

  - DocLauncher task creation form
  - XML parameter handling
  - Response display and error handling
- API Logging System:
  - Daily log rotation
  - Request/response tracking
  - Error monitoring
  - Debugging support
  - JSON-formatted log entries
  - Smart object serialization
  - Complex object handling

### Planned
- Additional CLM API use cases:
  - Use Case 2 (TBD)
  - Use Case 3 (TBD)
  - Use Case 4 (TBD)
  - Use Case 5 (TBD)
- Enhanced error handling
- Task status tracking
- Webhook integration for status updates

## Changelog
[Previous changelog entries removed for brevity]

### [2025-02-13]
- Streamlined authentication and credential management:
  - Removed hardcoded account credentials from configuration
  - Combined credential collection into a single pre-authentication form:
    - DocuSign Integration Key (Client ID)
    - DocuSign Secret Key
    - DocuSign Account ID
  - Improved user experience by collecting all required credentials upfront
  - Enhanced validation to ensure all credentials are provided before authentication
  - Updated authentication system to use user-provided credentials
  - Improved error handling and validation for credential inputs
  - Enhanced security by storing credentials in session state
  - Added automatic configuration loading after successful authentication
  - Added clear user feedback for configuration status

### [2025-02-11]
- Enhanced DocuSign authentication and Docker setup:
  - Enabled CORS to resolve compatibility issue with XSRF protection
  - Maintained security by keeping XSRF protection enabled
  - Implemented dynamic redirect URI handling for DocuSign authentication
  - Improved remote access support:
    - Removed automatic browser redirection for better cross-machine compatibility
    - Added copyable DocuSign authentication URL
    - Enhanced user guidance for remote access
  - Updated to use modern Streamlit query parameter handling
  - Optimized Docker container accessibility:
    - Updated Streamlit server configuration for container access
    - Configured proper network binding for Docker environment
    - Ensured consistent access across different environments
  - Improved UI layout:
    - Added DocuSign logo to header
    - Created two-column layout for better visual organization
    - Added optional search functionality with toggle
    - Reorganized configuration selection interface
    - Enhanced search results display

## Remote Access Guide
To access the application from a different machine:
1. Access the app using the host machine's IP: http://host-ip:8501?base_url=http://host-ip:8501
2. Click "Connect to DocuSign"
3. Copy the provided authentication URL
4. Open the copied URL in your browser to complete authentication
5. You will be redirected back to the application with proper authentication

Note: Replace "host-ip" with the actual IP address of the machine running the Docker container.

### [2025-02-10]
- Major application refocus to CLM API:
  - Removed eSignature template sending functionality
  - Implemented DocLauncher Tasks API integration (Use Case 1):
    - Added account ID input field
    - Integrated docgen configurations API endpoint
    - Created configuration selection dropdown
    - Added XML payload input with validation
    - Implemented DocLauncher task creation
    - Added DocLauncher Result URL display
  - Updated logging system for CLM API calls
  - Modified UI to support CLM operations

## Next Steps
1. Implement Use Case 2 for CLM API
2. Add task status tracking
3. Implement webhook handling for status updates
4. Add error handling and user feedback improvements
5. Implement remaining CLM API use cases
